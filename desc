The modules scrapes the play by play data for NBA games from espn.com along with the team info and parses the commentary to generate a structured schema to be able to query them and obtain insights and data breakdowns we want.

Example game play data is available here: http://www.espn.com/nba/playbyplay?gameId=401126813

The data parsed is flat file having the following fields

game_id -> ESPN game id
quarter > game quarter
q_time -> time elapsed in the quarter
q_time_remaining -> time remaining in the quarter
team -> team assocaited with the event
event -> event in the game. The actual commentary
score -> game score corresponding to the event (after the event)
team1_score -> away team score corresponding to the event
team2_score -> home team score corresponding to the event
team1_event_point -> point corresponding to the event for away team (0 more non scoring events)
team2_event_point -> point corresponding to the event for home team
player1 -> player 1 for the event (main subject of the event)
player2 -> player 2 for the event
action text -> main action of the event
action_what -> extra details about the main event
foot_value text -> foot value if any associated with the action
free_throw text -> free throw shot number if it is a free throw event
point_info text -> extra info about points
player_secondary text -> secondary player for the event (one who has the assist or steal etc...)
action_secondary text -> secondary action
team_action text -> team action

The parsed data being flat file can be inserted into a relational database table and we can use them to answer various question using SQL queries. I created a postges database for this purpose and a table within the db to insert the data and run query against,

For example:

- How many points did Kevin Durant score in each game ?

Answer:
-------
select game_id, sum(team1_event_point) + sum(team2_event_point) as total_points from plays_201819 where player1 = 'Kevin Durant' and action = 'makes' group by 1;


- How many misses does Keven Durant have every game ?
 
Answer:
-------
select game_id, count(*) as total_points from plays_201819 where player1 = 'Kevin Durant' and action = 'misses' group by 1;

- How many misses by shot type does Kevin Durant have ?

Answer:
-------
select action_what, count(*) as count from plays_201819 where player1 = 'Kevin Durant' and action = 'misses' group by 1 order by 1;


 - How many points did each team score in every game by pointer (1, 2, or 3)  ?

Answer:
-------
select
game_id,
team,
team1_event_point + team2_event_point,
sum(team1_event_point + team2_event_point) as points
from plays_201819
where team1_event_point + team2_event_point != 0
group by 1, 2, 3
order by 1, 2, 3;

- What is the percentage of points by pointer for each team

Answer:
-------
select
a.team,
a.pointer,
a.points,
round(100*cast(a.points as numeric)/b.points, 2) as percent_total_points
from
(
select
team,
team1_event_point + team2_event_point as pointer,
sum(team1_event_point + team2_event_point) as points
from plays_201819
where team1_event_point + team2_event_point != 0
group by 1, 2
) a
join
(
select
team,
sum(team1_event_point + team2_event_point) as points
from plays_201819
where team1_event_point + team2_event_point != 0
group by 1
) b
on a.team = b.team
and a.pointer <= 3
order by 1, 2;


- Who are the top 10 players by layups made ?

Answer:
-------
select player1, count(*) as total_layups from plays_201819 where action = 'makes' and action_what like '%layup%' group by 1 order by 2 desc limit 10;


- Who are the top 10 player combo for blocks made ? (player1 blocking player2)

Answer:
-------
select player1, player2, count(*) as num_blocks from plays_201819 where action = 'blocks' group by 1, 2 order by 3 desc limit 10


The data only includes the playoff games until 05/05/2019. But the process can be run to obtain data for all the games in the season. There are some very minor inconsistencies in the data due to the type in the commentary onthe site. Though there are means to correct them and clean the data, cretain edge cases still need to be addressed.

There is pg_dump file (nba_pg_dump.pgsql) for the postgres db containing the mentioned games in the main folder 

Directories:
------------

scripts => has the scripts used to extract and process the data

html_files => has the extracted html files for each game

html_scoreboard_files => scoecard html file by date

parsed_data => the data pasres and processed form the raw html files. The sub directory "plays_processed" has the final processed falt file for each game which is used to insert into the DB
